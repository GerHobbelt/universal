\# Bessel Functions



Absolutely, Theodore. Let‚Äôs dive into the three remaining Bessel variants‚Äî\\( Y\_n(x) \\), \\( I\_n(x) \\), and \\( K\_n(x) \\)‚Äîwith a focus on how they‚Äôre defined, how they behave, and how we might implement them in a Universal-compatible way.

\## üßÆ 1. Bessel Function of the Second Kind: \\( Y\_n(x) \\)



\### üîπ Definition

Also called the \*\*Neumann function\*\*, \\( Y\_n(x) \\) is a solution to the same differential equation as \\( J\_n(x) \\), but it‚Äôs singular at \\( x = 0 \\). It‚Äôs defined via:



\\\[

Y\_n(x) = \\frac{J\_n(x) \\cos(n\\pi) - J\_{-n}(x)}{\\sin(n\\pi)}

\\]



For integer \\( n \\), this becomes ill-defined due to division by zero, so we use a \*\*limit-based definition\*\* or recurrence relations.



\### üîπ Behavior

\- Diverges logarithmically as \\( x \\to 0 \\)

\- Oscillatory for large \\( x \\), like \\( J\_n(x) \\), but phase-shifted



\### üîπ Implementation Strategy

\- Use recurrence relations:

&nbsp; \\\[

&nbsp; Y\_{n+1}(x) = \\frac{2n}{x} Y\_n(x) - Y\_{n-1}(x)

&nbsp; \\]

\- Start with known values for \\( Y\_0(x) \\) and \\( Y\_1(x) \\), which can be approximated via series or asymptotics

\## üî• 2. Modified Bessel Function of the First Kind: \\( I\_n(x) \\)



\### üîπ Definition

This is the \*\*non-oscillatory\*\* analog of \\( J\_n(x) \\), useful for problems with exponential growth or decay (e.g. heat conduction, diffusion):



\\\[

I\_n(x) = i^{-n} J\_n(ix)

\\]



It has a series expansion:

\\\[

I\_n(x) = \\sum\_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k! \\, \\Gamma(k + n + 1)} \\left( \\frac{x}{2} \\right)^{2k + n}

\\]



\### üîπ Behavior

\- Smooth and \*\*exponentially increasing\*\* for large \\( x \\)

\- Well-behaved at \\( x = 0 \\)



\### üîπ Implementation Strategy

\- Use direct series expansion (similar to \\( J\_n(x) \\), but all terms positive)

\- Recurrence relations also available:

&nbsp; \\\[

&nbsp; I\_{n+1}(x) = I\_{n-1}(x) - \\frac{2n}{x} I\_n(x)

&nbsp; \\]

\## ‚ùÑÔ∏è 3. Modified Bessel Function of the Second Kind: \\( K\_n(x) \\)



\### üîπ Definition

Also known as the \*\*Macdonald function\*\*, \\( K\_n(x) \\) is defined via:



\\\[

K\_n(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{I\_{-n}(x) - I\_n(x)}{\\sin(n\\pi)}

\\]



For integer \\( n \\), this simplifies using limits or recurrence.



\### üîπ Behavior

\- \*\*Decays exponentially\*\* as \\( x \\to \\infty \\)

\- \*\*Singular\*\* at \\( x = 0 \\)



\### üîπ Implementation Strategy

\- Use recurrence:

&nbsp; \\\[

&nbsp; K\_{n+1}(x) = K\_{n-1}(x) + \\frac{2n}{x} K\_n(x)

&nbsp; \\]

\- Start from known values \\( K\_0(x) \\), \\( K\_1(x) \\) via asymptotic or integral approximations
