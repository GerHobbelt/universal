Image Preprocessing Precondition:
 - Load images and convert them to a suitable format (e.g., grayscale or feature vectors).
 - Normalize pixel values to a common range (e.g., 0-1).

RBF Network Training Steps:
 - Center Selection: 
	Choose a subset of training images as centers for the RBF units.
 - Width Parameter: 
        Determine the width parameter (sigma) for the RBF functions, controlling their influence.
 - Weight Training: 
	Use a supervised learning algorithm (e.g., gradient descent) to adjust the weights connecting 
	the RBF layer to the output layer.

Image Classification Postcondition:
  - For a new image, calculate the activation of each RBF unit based on its distance from the centers.
  - Feed the activations to the output layer and use a decision rule (e.g., maximum activation) to determine the class.
